  abstract = {{This is the greatly revised and greatly expanded Second Edition of
	the hugely popular Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing.
	The product of a unique collaboration among four leading scientists
	in academic research and industry Numerical Recipes is a complete
	text and reference book on scientific computing. In a self-contained
	manner it proceeds from mathematical and theoretical considerations
	to actual practical computer routines. With over 100 new routines
	bringing the total to well over 300, plus upgraded versions of the
	original routines, this new edition remains the most practical, comprehensive
	handbook of scientific computing available today. Highlights of the
	new material include: -A new chapter on integral equations and inverse
	methods -Multigrid and other methods for solving partial differential
	equations -Improved random number routines - Wavelet transforms -The
	statistical bootstrap method -A new chapter on "less-numerical" algorithms
	including compression coding and arbitrary precision arithmetic.
	The book retains the informal easy-to-read style that made the first
	edition so popular, while introducing some more advanced topics.
	It is an ideal textbook for scientists and engineers and an indispensable
	reference for anyone who works in scientific computing. The Second
	Edition is availabe in FORTRAN, the traditional language for numerical
	calculations and in the increasingly popular C language.}},
